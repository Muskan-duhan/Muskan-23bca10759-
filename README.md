The Hotel Reservation System is a software
application developed to simplify and streamline the
operations of hotels, focusing on room booking, guest
management, and payment processing. In today's fast-
paced and competitive hospitality industry, managing
hotel operations manually is inefficient and prone to
errors. This system aims to provide a digital solution
that improves accuracy, saves time, and enhances
guest satisfaction through automation and real-time
data access.
The system is designed to serve three types of
users: guests, hotel staff, and administrators. Guests
can browse available rooms, make bookings, and view
their reservation details. Hotel staff are responsible
for managing reservations, updating room statuses,
and handling check-ins, check-outs, and payments.
Administrators oversee the entire system, manage
employee records, and generate reports to monitor
hotel performance and revenue.
With the increasing demand for online services and
real-time access to information, this system ensures
that guests have a smooth and convenient booking
experience. At the same time, it enables hotel staff to
focus more on customer service rather than manual
data entry and coordination.
